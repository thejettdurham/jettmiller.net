	<h1>Testimonials</h1>
	
	<p>Welcome to my Testimonials!  Here you'll find kind words spoken about me from people I've worked with in the past.  Some are from people I've worked with, some are from people I've worked for.  I believe a few kind words about yourself from someone else is 10 times more powerful than a thousand words you write about yourself.  If you want to get a sense of who I am from the perspective of a client or a colleague, this is where you need to be!</p>

		<p>Jett was hired by our company to migrate our existing eCommerce website to a new, more flexible platform. Several companies had already turned us down due to the complex nature of the task.  Jett, however, was very swift and thorough in completing the job!  He was not deterred by the difficulties involved and worked very well with our webmaster. We couldn't be happier with our final product!  Jett also took the time to teach our customer service manager how to maintain the new website. Our website is exactly what we dreamed it would be after 3 years! Our company would recommend him to anyone. He was very professional and polite to boot. We will hire him again for future services.</p>

		<p>Jett is an extremely capable web developer. His adaptability and willingness to learn new skillsets make him a valuable addition to any team. Furthermore, he seems equally comfortable leading projects and following others' leads. I would be surprised if I don't see great things from Jett in the next few years.</p>

		<p>Jett has been a valuable coworker. Not only is he pleasant to work with, he has a solid understanding of web development. He is good with a range of competencies from managing client relations to diagnosing and correcting back-end problems. Web designers encounter a number of different technical languages daily, many of which Jett either understands or can infer well. Anything he does not know he can learn quickly and doesn't hesitate to do so. I believe Jettâ€™s strongest skill is his ability to think critically and to offer solid solutions. He is a proven problem solver. In addition to his higher cognitive thinking, he is a welcomed team member. I would definitely love to keep working with him.</p>

		<p class="small-drop">Welcome to my Internet Abode!  Chances are you were referred to this site to look at my portfolio, read my resume, or peruse my glowing testimonials.  I probably was the one who led you here, but if not, that's great!  Give that person a big hug for me!  Or a high five. Whatever you're more comfortable with.</p>
	
		<p>I'm a web designer and developer based out of not-too-hot, not-too-cold Wichita, Kansas.  I'm a member of the strange specimen of web worker who can easily bridge the gap between beautiful front-end design and elegant back-end code.  I'm passionate about writing code that's semantic, clean, readable, scalable, and modular.  I'm driven to keep pushing myself to learn more tools and technologies to broaden my own skill-set and to put those skills to use to help others realize their perfect website.</p>

		<p class="small-drop">Although Web Design is what I'm best known for, I prefer to think of myself as more of a problem solver than anything too specific.  Whether I'm designing a logo, writing a PHP script, learning to play a difficult passage of music, editing a music video, or working through calculus problems, I can apply a logical process to the problem that will lead me to the best solution.  I have a talent for breaking a complex problem down into it's constituent events, tracing them back to the root causes, identifying the right tools to use, and putting it all together to develop meaningful and impactful solutions.</p>
		
		<p>I'm an avid learner and am constantly seeking out new information to absorb and add to my toolkit.  I treat every project I take on as an opportunity to learn something I didn't already know.  Recently I've discovered online learning resources such as learning libraries like <a href="http://www.lynda.com" target="_blank">Lynda.com</a> and <a href="http://www.teamtreehouse.com" target="_blank">Treehouse</a> that take full advantage of the rich media web to make acquiring new skills fun and engaging.  In fact, the time I've spent at Treehouse and the marketable skills it has taught me opened the door for me to pursue web design and development as a full-time career.</p>

		<p class="small-drop">Web Design is my primary creative outlet, but I also like to dabble in other creative ventures.  Music is a little more than a passing fancy for me.  I've been a guitar player for over 10 years and have made a lot of friends, had a lot of good times, and played with some incredible musicians and bands in my time with performing in rock bands around town.  These days I'm more content to collaborate with musicians via YouTube and write and record music for myself.  I also like to do video editing, photography, print design, logo design, and almost anything that falls under the <em>creative</em> umbrella.  I've even experimented with video game design.</p>

		<p>If my copywriter did his job right, you should feel like you know me now a little better than you did a few minutes ago.  If you feel this isn't the case, please <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">contact me</a> and I will see to it that he is sacked.  If you want to see what kinds of things I've worked on, head over to my <a href="portfolio.html" target="_blank">portfolio</a>.  For a more technical and in-depth look at my skill-set and work history, take a look at my <a href="resume.html" target="_blank">resume</a>.
